Bourbon whiskey is a type of American whiskey, a barrel-aged distilled spirit made primarily from corn. The name is derived from the French Bourbon dynasty, although it is unclear precisely what inspired the whiskey's name (contenders include Bourbon County in Kentucky and Bourbon Street in New Orleans). Bourbon has been distilled since the 18th century. The use of the term "bourbon" for the whiskey has been traced to the 1820s, and the term began to be used consistently in Kentucky in the 1870s. While bourbon may be made anywhere in the United States, it is strongly associated with the American South, and with Kentucky in particular.
Bourbon is made with corn and obtains its distinct flavor as it’s aged in barrels.

Pisco is a colorless or yellowish-to-amber colored brandy produced in winemaking regions of Peru and Chile. Made by distilling fermented grape juice into a high-proof spirit, it was developed by 16th century Spanish settlers as an alternative to orujo, a pomace brandy that was being imported from Spain. It had the advantages of being produced from abundant domestically grown fruit and reducing the volume of alcoholic beverages transported to remote locations.
Its “smooth and almost non-alcoholic flavor” deceives many first-time drinkers, who quickly become inebriated without noticing.

The cocktail may also be contrasted with the Michelada, which has similar flavouring ingredients but uses beer instead of vodka.
Spaghetti alle vongole, or spaghetti with tomato sauce and clams, served as Walter Chell’s inspiration for the Caesar, taking this classic from Venice, Italy all across Canada.
