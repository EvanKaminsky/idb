- Balazs: I designed the backend of our website. This includes the interface to our database, the implementation of our api calls, as well as our search engine (complete with support for sorting, filtering, and paginating results on the backend). I also set up our python unit testing suite, implemented automatic code styling, scraped card colors from our image urls, and maintained our API documentation.
